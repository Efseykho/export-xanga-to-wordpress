=========================ABOUT=========================
Remember the glory-days of blogging; when it was still new and exciting? When people did not quite know what to make of it? Back before it was about self-promotion and aggrandizement. Yeah, that'd be like 8 years ago.

Back then, there were only a few blogging platforms. Xanga was one of the majors, lj was the other. All the 'cool kids' were on lj cause it was the hip, emo-place to be. Also cause they had excellent support for groups and their comment system was solid. Xanga was at that time trying to be hip and anti-emo; gray themes were banned outright, I think. Anyway, it was a cool place for a few years and even though the audience was less 'mature' than a lot of other places, it had a very tight-knit community of interesting people behind it.
    
This was sometime before they went and turned into an MS-sweat shop and started showing obnoxious ads. Now, its faded into irrelevance. 

Long story short, if you have/had an account and would like to pull your data out of it, this will scrape xanga with your username/pw and write out a wordpress-compatible xml for import.

Here's what wordpress suggests you use:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content
"xanga.r is a program that parses xanga pages to get the post and comments. Then it can output them in the WordPress rss 2.0 xml format for WordPress to import."

The script's got some limitations, etc and did not work for me. Since I could not figure out what was wrong with it, I thought I'd rewrite it myself and practice ruby all at the same time.

This looks very promising but I've not used it myself cause by the time I found out about it, I'd already written my c0dez.

=========================Dependencies=========================
Mechanize and Hpricot >=0.7
Hpricot did not handle complex xml that well prior to that release. It might work for you but I can't guarantee it.


=========================Usage=========================
      XangaScraper.new("user-name","password").scrape(:max_blog_entries => 3 )
This will scrape the xanga account of given user with the provided password and output a wordpress.xml in the cwd.
You can then try importing it into wordpress. Good luck!

Options passable to XangaScraper:
    @options[:default_title] = "My Awesome Title"
    @options[:default_link] = "http://default.wordpress.com"
    @options[:default_description] = "My Awesome Description"
    @options[:pub_date] = "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 00:12:59 +0000"
    @options[:base_blog_url] = "http://default.wordpress.com"
    @options[:creator] = "Hiro"
  
  Options passable to XangaScraper::scrape:
    options[:max_blog_entries] = nil #max number of entries to scrape, defaults to scraping everything
    
=========================Limitations=========================
* Only first page of comments is scraped (up to 25, methinks).
* I don't really know ruby. Like, AT ALL. Please be gentle with my c0dez.
* Hierarchical structure of comments is destroyed when imported into
   wordpress. For right now, I think its a bug in wordpress. Will investigate
   as time allows.

=========================ToDo=========================
* scrape multi-page of comments; I currently scrape <= 25
* figure out why on import all hierarchical comment info is lost
* add licensing info, i spose, to make it look more real
* maybe rdoc-style comments
